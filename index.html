      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        HGS Preloved — short for <em>Hot Girl Sh!t</em> — is a personal project born from my love of fashion and the thrill of finding hidden gems and one-off statement pieces.
        I handpick vintage and designer treasures that deserve a second life, focusing on timeless style, quality, and sustainable fashion.
      </p>
      <p>Each item is chosen with care and made to be loved again. ❤️</p>
